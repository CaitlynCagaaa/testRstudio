# testRstudio

The point of this project is to build a shiny app where you upload a cvs file and can do a variety of statistical tests with the information in said file.

Currently just has file upload. The next steps will be making a selection bar for the columns and/or rows , so you can pick a variable to do tests on. Then using that selection to do a test that the person selects. May also include the ability to make graphs. May also mess with the layout if its necessary.
